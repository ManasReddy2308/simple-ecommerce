# Ecommerce Frontend

This is a light React frontend (Vite compatible) using fetch to talk to the backend.

Install dependencies and run (recommended to use Node 18+):

1. npm install
2. Set REACT_APP_API_URL if backend runs on a non-default URL
3. npm run dev (for vite) or use your preferred dev server

Note: This small scaffold uses `fetch` and localStorage for the JWT token.
